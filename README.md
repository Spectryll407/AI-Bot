# üîó Comfyui : Bjornulf_custom_nodes v0.22 üîó

# ‚òÅ Usage in cloud : 

If you want to use my nodes and comfyui in the cloud, I'm managing an optimized template on runpod : <https://runpod.io/console/deploy?template=r32dtr35u1&ref=tkowk7g5>  
Template name : `bjornulf-comfyui-allin-workspace`, can be operational in ~3 minutes. (Depending on your pod)  
You need to create and select a network volume before using that, size is up to you, i have 50Gb Storage because i use cloud only for Flux or lora training on a 4090. (~0.7$/hour)  
‚ö†Ô∏è When pod is ready, you need to open a terminal in browser (After clicking on `connect` from your pod) and use this to launch ComfyUI manually : `cd /workspace/ComfyUI && python main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 3000` (Much better to control it with a terminal, check logs, etc...)  
After that you can just click on the `Connect to port 3000` button.  
As file manager, you can use the included `JupyterLab` on port 8888.  
If you have any issues with it, please let me know.  
For me : I have a computer with 4070 super with 12Gb and flux fp8 simple wokflow is about ~40 seconds. With a 4090 in the cloud I can run flux fp16 in ~12 seconds.  
It will manage everything in Runpod network storage (`/workspace/ComfyUI`), so you can stop and start the cloud GPU without losing anything, change GPU or whatever.  
Zone : I recommend `EU-RO-1`, but up to you.  
Top-up your Runpod account with minimum 10$ to start.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning, you will pay by the minute, so not recommended for testing or learning comfyui. Do that locally !!!  
Run cloud GPU only when you already have your workflow ready to run.  
Advice : take a cheap GPU for testing, downloading models or settings things up.  
To download checkpoint or anything else, you need to use the terminal, here is all you need for flux as an example :

![Show Text](screenshots/write+show_text.png)
![Show Text](screenshots/write_in_console.png)

**Description:**  
Three simple nodes to write and show text.  
Write node is a textarea where you can write your text.  
The show text node will only display the text. (That's why I made it a different color : green, uneditable, display only.)   
Write text node now allow for special syntax to accept random variants, like `{hood|helmet}` will randomly choose between hood or helmet.

![Resize and Save Exact](screenshots/resize_save_exact.png)

**Description:**  
Resize an image to exact dimensions. The other node will save the image to the exact path.  
‚ö†Ô∏èüí£ Warning : The image will be overwritten if it already exists.

## 15 - üíæ Save Text
![Save Text](screenshots/save_text.png)

**Description:**  
Save the given text input to a file. Useful for logging and storing text data.

## 16 - üñºüí¨ Save image for Bjornulf LobeChat (‚ùóFor my custom [lobe-chat](https://github.com/justUmen/Bjornulf_lobe-chat)‚ùó)
![Save Bjornulf Lobechat](screenshots/save_bjornulf_lobechat.png)

**Description:**  
‚ùì I made that node for my custom lobe-chat to send+receive images from Comfyui API : [lobe-chat](https://github.com/justUmen/Bjornulf_lobe-chat)  
It will save the image in the folder `output/BJORNULF_LOBECHAT/`. 
The name will start at `api_00001.png`, then `api_00002.png`, etc...  
It will also create a link to the last generated image at the location `output/BJORNULF_API_LAST_IMAGE.png`.  
This link will be used by my custom lobe-chat to copy the image inside the lobe-chat project.  

## 17 - üñº Save image as `tmp_api.png` Temporary API ‚ö†Ô∏èüí£
![Save Temporary API](screenshots/save_tmp_api.png)

**Description:**

## 18 - üñºüìÅ Save image to a chosen folder name
![Save Temporary API](screenshots/save_image_to_folder.png)

**Description:**  
Save image in a specific folder : `my_folder/00001.png`, `my_folder/00002.png`, etc...  
Also allow multiple nested folders, like for example : `animal/dog/small`.

## 19 - ü¶ô Ollama
![Show Text](screenshots/ollama.png)

**Description:**  
Will generate detailed text based of what you give it.  
I recommend using `mistral-nemo` if you can run it, but it's up to you. (Might have to tweak the system prompt a bit)  
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning : Having an ollama node that will run for each generation might be a bit heavy on your VRAM. Think about if you really need it or not.

**Description:**  
Straight forward node to write and show text.

## 20 - üìπ Video Ping Pong
![Video Ping Pong](screenshots/video_pingpong.png)

**Description:**  
Create a ping-pong effect from a list of images (from a video) by reversing the playback direction when reaching the last frame. Good for an "infinity loop" effect.

## 21 - üìπ Images to Video
![Images to Video](screenshots/imgs2video.png)

**Description:**  
Combine a sequence of images into a video file.  
‚ùì I made this node because it supports transparency with webm format. (Needed for rembg)  
Temporary images are stored in the folder `ComfyUI/temp_images_imgs2video/` as well as the wav audio file.

## 22 - üî≤ Remove image Transparency (alpha)
![Remove Alpha](screenshots/remove_alpha.png)

**Description:**  
Remove transparency from an image by filling the alpha channel with a solid color. (black, white or greenscreen)  
Of course it takes in an image with transparency, like from rembg nodes.  
Necessary for some nodes that don't support transparency.  

## 23 - üî≤ Image to grayscale (black & white)
![Image to Grayscale](screenshots/grayscale.png)

**Description:**  
Convert an image to grayscale (black & white)  
Example : I sometimes use it with Ipadapter to disable color influence.  
But you can sometimes also want a black and white image... 

## 24 - üñº+üñº Combine images (Background + Overlay)
![Combine Images](screenshots/combine_background_overlay.png)

**Description:**  
Combine two images into a single image : a background and one (or several) transparent overlay. (allow to have a video there, just send all the frames and recombine them after.)  
Update 0.11 : Add option to move vertically and horizontally. (from -50% to 150%)  
‚ùó Warning : For now, `background` is a static image. (I will allow video there later too.)  
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning : If you want to directly load the image with transparency, use my node `üñº Load Image with Transparency ‚ñ¢` instead of the `Load Image` node.  

## 25 - üü©‚ûú‚ñ¢ Green Screen to Transparency
![Greenscreen to Transparency](screenshots/greeenscreen_to_transparency.png)

**Description:**  
Transform greenscreen into transparency.  
Need clean greenscreen ofc. (Can adjust threshold but very basic node.)

## 26 - üé≤ Random line from input
![Random line from input](screenshots/random_line_from_input.png)

**Description:**  
Take a random line from an input text. (When using multiple "Write Text" nodes is annoying for example, you can use that and just copy/paste a list from outside.)

## 27 - ‚ôª Loop (All Lines from input)
![Loop input](screenshots/loop_all_lines.png)

**Description:**  
Iterate over all lines from an input text. (Good for testing multiple lines of text.)

## 28 - üî¢ Text with random Seed

**Description:**  

‚ùó This node is used to force to generate a random seed, along with text.  
But what does that mean ???  
When you use a loop (‚ôª), the loop will use the same seed for each iteration. (That is the point, it will keep the same seed to compare results.)  
Even with `randomize` for `control_after_generate`, it is still using the same seed for every loop, it will change it only when the workflow is done.  
Simple example without using random seed node : (Both images have different prompt, but same seed)  

![Text with random Seed 1](screenshots/random_seed_1.png)

So if you want to force using another seed for each iteration, you can use this node in the middle.
For example, if you want to generate a different image every time. (aka : You use loop nodes not to compare or test results but to generate multiple images.)  
Use it like that for example : (Both images have different prompt AND different seed)  

![Text with random Seed 2](screenshots/random_seed_2.png)

Here is an example of the similarities that you want to avoid with FLUX with different prompt (hood/helmet) but same seed :

![Text with random Seed 3](screenshots/random_seed_3_flux.png)

Here is an example of the similarities that you want to avoid with SDXL with different prompt (blue/red) but same seed :

![Text with random Seed 4](screenshots/random_seed_4_sdxl.png)

FLUX : Here is an example of 4 images without Random Seed node on the left, and on the right 4 images with Random Seed node :

![Text with random Seed 5](screenshots/result_random_seed.png)

## 29 - üñº Load Image with Transparency ‚ñ¢
![Load image Alpha](screenshots/load_image_alpha.png)

**Description:**  
Load an image with transparency.  
The default `Load Image` node will not load the transparency.  

## 30 - üñº‚úÇ Cut image with a mask
![Cut image](screenshots/image_mask_cut.png)

**Description:**  
Cut an image from a mask.  

## 31 - üîä TTS - Text to Speech
![TTS](screenshots/tts.png)

**Description:**  
Use my TTS server to generate speech from text.  
‚ùó Of course you need to use my TTS server : <https://github.com/justUmen/Bjornulf_XTTS>  
After having that installed, you NEED to create a link in my Comfyui custom node folder called `speakers` : `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/Bjornulf_custom_nodes/speakers`  
That link must must be a link to the folder where you store the voice samples you use for my TTS, like `default.wav`.  
If my TTS server is running on port 8020 (You can test in browser with the link <http://localhost:8020/tts_stream?language=en&speaker_wav=default&text=Hello>) and voice samples are good, you can use this node to generate speech from text.  

### 32 - üßëüìù Character Description Generator
![characters](screenshots/characters.png)
![characters](screenshots/characters2.png)

**Description:**  
Generate a character description based on a json file in the folder `characters` : `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/Bjornulf_custom_nodes/characters`  
Make your own json file with your own characters, and use this node to generate a description.  
‚ùó For now it's very basic node, a lot of things are going to be added and changed !!!  
Some details are unusable for some checkpoints, very much a work in progress, the json structure isn't set in stone either.  

### 33 - ‚ôª Loop (All Lines from input üîó combine by lines)

![loop combined](screenshots/loop_combined.png)

**Description:**  
Sometimes you want to loop over several inputs but you also want to separate different lines of your output.  
So with this node, you can have the number of inputs and outputs you want. See example for usage.  

### 34 - üßπ Free VRAM hack
![free vram](screenshots/free_vram_hack1.png)
![free vram](screenshots/free_vram_hack2.png)

**Description:**  
So this is my attempt at freeing up VRAM after usage, I will try to improve that.  
For me, on launch ComfyUI is using 180MB of VRAM, after my clean up VRAM node it can go back down to 376MB.  
I don't think there is a clean way to do that, so I'm using a hacky way.  
So, not perfect but better than being stuck at 6GB of VRAM used if I know I won't be using it again...  
Just connect this node with your workflow, it takes an image as input and return the same image without any changes.  
‚ùó Comfyui is using cache to run faster (like not reloading checkpoints), so only use this free VRAM node when you need it.  
‚ùó For this node to work properly, you need to enable the dev/api mode in ComfyUI. (You can do that in the settings)
